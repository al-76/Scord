SCoRd - Swift/Combine/Redux

A simple Redux implementation with Combine.
That's just a prototype to test some conceptions and approaches in Redux.
Something like TCA with middlewares.

* No support for effective schemes like viewStore in TCA to control state observation
* Burden syntax with composing reducers, middlewares (no enum case paths for example)
* No syntax sugar in some places like optional states
